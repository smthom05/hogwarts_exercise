#You are to create an app and complete this following user story:

```
As a user
When I visit "/"
And I select "Slytherin" from the dropdown
And I click on "Get Students"
Then my path should be "/search" with "house=slytherin" in the parameters
And I should see a message "22 Students"
And I should see a list of the 22 members of Slytherin
And I should see a name and id for each student. -->
